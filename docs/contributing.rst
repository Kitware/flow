    Contributing
====================

To contribute features and fixes, create a Git branch for your work: ::

    git checkout -b my-topic-name

Commit your changes to that branch, then push the topic to GitHub: ::

    git push -u origin my-topic-name

Due to setting upstream with `-u`, after new commits, you may simply: ::

    git push

Use the GitHub pull request feature to suggest a topic for inclusion.
Use GitHub tools to check for a clean Travis CI build and merge to the ``master`` branch.
